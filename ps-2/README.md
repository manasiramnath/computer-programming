### Problem Set 2, AT 2023

#### \*\*\* Due 12:00 noon on Monday, October 23 \*\*\*

---

The goal of this problem set is to practice writing and calling functions in Python. The different problems will lead you through a simplified implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Thus, the assignment will also help you gain a better understanding of a popular unsupervised machine learning technique.

The problem set will be marked and contribute 10% towards your final mark for the course.
