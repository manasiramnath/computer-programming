    "### Writing your own binary classifier evaluation module\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the supervised-learning equivalent of clustering, which we briefly touched on in Problem Set 2. A classifier is used to label an observation as belonging to one of a finite number of categories, or classes. We use labeled training data to build the classifier and then use the classifier to predict the categories that new observations belong to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, we will build our own module for working with and evaluating binary classifiers and write unit tests for it. We will then use the module to evaluate k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification on social data. We will use the scikit-learn package to run the KNN algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use data from the file `../data/house-votes-84.data`. The file contains information on the voting record from the 1984 United States Congress. Our goal will be to predict whether the voter is a Democrat based on how they voted on 16 separate occasions. The data are obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and you can find more information about them in the file `../data/house-votes-84.names` as well as [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records).\n",

    "Create a .py file called `class_eval.py` and in it write a function called `split_training_testing()` that takes as arguments a list of data points and a number indicating the percent of data to be used for testing. The function should randomly assign data points to either the training or testing sets, where the size of the sets is determined by the percent passed as an argument. The function should return the training and testing sets, in that particular order. The term \"set\" here comes from machine learning and you should not take it literally. The two outputs your function returns should be in fact of type `list`. \n",
