### Problem Set 3, AT 2023

#### \*\*\* Due 12:00 noon on Monday, November 6 \*\*\*

---

The goal of this problem set is to practice writing and initializing classes in Python. The different problems will lead you through a simplified implementation of a simulation model for a contagion process on an empirical network. We expect you to work on the problem set with your assigned partner and to make full use of GitHub to facilitate the collaboration.

The problem set will be marked and contribute 10% towards your final mark for the course.
